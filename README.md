# Scalable Notification Service

This is a repository containing source code described in blog posts about building scalable notification service.
The blog posts are available at [https://engineeringwithfilip.com](https://engineeringwithfilip.com).

Not all problems are the same. What works for this simple case might, or might not be the best fit for your problem. 
The purpose of these blog posts is to highlight the reasoning behind decisions that impact service scalability, as well as some other trade-offs we have to make during development.

Hopefully, we will reach 1 million notifications per minute. Each step of the journey will be documented as a blog post.

## Running the project
 - Download the source code
 - Execute `docker-compose up` to start the required services
